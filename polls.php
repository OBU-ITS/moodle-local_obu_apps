<h3>polls.brookes</h3>

The polls.brookes app allows Oxford Brookes staff and students to participate in online polls.  Currently, new polls can only be designed and controlled by staff members.<p />
Itâ€™s really good looking and easy to use on any device.

<h4>Joining a poll</h4>

Enter the poll number that you see in the Moodle activity for the poll and Submit.

<h4>Participating in a poll</h4>
